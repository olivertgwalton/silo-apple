//  PlayerCore.swift
//  Continuum (iOS + tvOS)
//
//  The single player core. Pipeline:
//
//    libavformat demux  →  video packet queue  →  VTDecompressionSession (async)
//                       \→ audio packet queue  →  FFmpeg SW decode + SwrContext
//                                                 → AVAudioEngine (AVAudioSourceNode)
//
//    Video is push-driven through `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` while audio is
//    rendered as decoded PCM through an `AVAudioEngine` graph, modeled after
//    KSPlayer's Apple backend. Color attachments come from ffmpeg.
//
//  HDR policy differs per platform:
//    - tvOS: HDMI mode is driven by AVDisplayManager. `onSigPeakChange` is a
//      no-op; the display layer's EDR flag is irrelevant because the compositor
//      negotiates HDR directly with the TV.
    //    - iOS / macOS: no HDMI to negotiate. HDR is driven by setting
    //      `preferredDynamicRange` on the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer
//      when the stream's transfer function is HDR and the user has HDR
//      enabled. `onSigPeakChange` fires so the hosting view can toggle EDR.
