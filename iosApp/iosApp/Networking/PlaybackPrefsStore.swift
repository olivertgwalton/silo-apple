//
//  PlaybackPrefsStore.swift
//  Continuum (iOS + tvOS)
//
//  In-memory cache of the user's per-library playback preferences,
//  hydrated lazily on first access and refreshed when the Settings UI
//  mutates a row. The settings UI is the only consumer that needs the
//  full list — playback time reads `effective_*` straight off the
//  WatchDetail response, so this store doesn't need to participate in
//  the hot path.
//
//  Per-series subtitle / audio overrides are not cached: they're
//  fetched on demand by the player (when the user picks "Remember for
//  this series") and re-fetched from `WatchDetail.effective_*` on the
//  next playback, so caching them here would just duplicate authority.
